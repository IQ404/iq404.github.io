# Welcome!

This is my personal space where I'll be sharing notes, tutorials, and thoughts on various topics including:

- **Mathematics** - From linear algebra to probability theory
- **Computer Science** - Algorithms, systems design, and programming
- **Research** - Updates on my PhD work and publications
- **Random Explorations** - Whatever interesting problems I encounter

## Why These Notes?

I've always believed that teaching is the best way to learn. By writing about topics I'm studying, I solidify my own understanding while hopefully helping others along the way.

## Interactive Content

One thing I'm excited about is the ability to include interactive visualizations directly in posts. Stay tuned for explorable explanations of mathematical concepts!
